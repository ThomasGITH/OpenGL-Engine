# OpenGL (Raw) 3D Game-Engine

An OpenGL-powered 3D game engine made using C++ and a variety of libraries including GLEW, GLFW and Assimp. To clarify the meaning of the word "raw": The engine does not have a window with a user interface as one might expect it to. Basically, you use it by building on top of the code that's already there (a.k.a. the engine). Currently, the user (me) can easily implement complex 3D objects, perform transformations on them (translate, scale, rotate), and change its material (the way the object is affected by specular lighting). The user can also easily create several different kinds of lights.

To clarify the (real) purpose of this project: It was made over the course of a couple of months as a way for me to both learn OpenGL and to gain more experience using C++. It was never actually intended to be used in practice. It was just a learning experience.

##### As of shortly before 9-11-2019 I have stopped working on this project and have moved on to other projects which may/may not also include OpenGL.
